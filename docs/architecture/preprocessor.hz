# Preprocessor

Preprocessors are basically regex based string replacement rules.
But for the better experiences, it can change how wide it should work on.

## Wideness Levels

- Main Text (0)
- Config Text (1)

## Example of Ruleset

``` hzdata;nd=1
{ version = 1, wideness_level = 0, pattern = /:([^:]+):/, replace = "[#emoji($1)]" }
{ version = 1, wideness_level = 0, pattern = /\([cC]\)/, replace = "â“’" }
```
